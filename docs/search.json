    "text": "… to the latest iteration of my advanced R course, where we will learn to analyse data in style.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease complete the course Introduction to Data Analysis with R prior to this one.\n\n\n\nMost participants will be biochemistry bachelor (and master) students, but the material is open to anyone!\n\nThere are 8 lectures in total, each accompanied by:\n\nA video of the lecture at the top of each page\nThe lecture script, which consists of the code written during the lecture (plus some more code to generate illustrative graphics) and explanations\nExercises to complete and send in\nA seminar to discuss the exercises\nA discord server to ask questions and share solutions\n\n\nIn addition to the 8 regular lectures + follow up seminars, there is an introductory seminar in the first week, before the first lecture.\n\nOctober 21: First seminar\nOctober 28: Seminar for the first lecture\nDecember 16: Seminar for the last lecture\n\nThe first seminar is dedicated to helping you get your laptops set up for the course, show the course structure and explain core concepts.\nI do recommend to watch the lecture in your own time, and then use the lecture script afterwards to look up concepts and code you want to revisit. Code chunks also have a copy-button, which is helpful for quickly playing around with it, but make sure you actually walk through the lecture and do the typing first, because muscle memory will server you well in the future.\n\n\nTo complete the course, hand in at least 5 out of 8 exercises. The important part here is not that each exercise is a perfect solution, but if you encounter questions and struggles during your attempt of the exercise, make sure to include those pain points as well so that we can cover those in the Seminar. Please hand in your solutions before the seminar via a direct message on discord. The earlier in the week you submit your solutions, the more time I have to prepare answers for the seminar.\n\n\n\nEach week, we will meet to discuss the exercises and answer any questions that might have have popped up. Currently it looks like it will be possible to do so in person, in which case we will meet here:\n\nTO BE ANNOUNCED\n\nEven though these are technically computer rooms, it would be great if you could bring your own laptop so that you can code along and known that you will be able to apply what you learned after the course as well. Also, we might not be able to install the necessary software in the computer room."

    "section": "Preamble: Sharpening the axe",
    "text": "Preamble: Sharpening the axe\nThere is this great quote attributed to Abraham Lincoln:\n\n“Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.” — Abraham Lincoln\n\nAnd while I did not verify that he actually said that, the message really resonates with me. To me, are actually two parts to this. The first part is the more obvious one. If you really know your tools well and take care of them, you save time in the long run. Chopping down a tree is simply faster with a well-sharpened axe, even with the initial time lost to sharpening taken into account. There is even an xkcd comic you can uses as a table to evaluate if you save more time on a task in the long run by automating it depending on how long it takes to build the automation:\n\n\n\nSource: https://xkcd.com/1205/\n\n\nThe same can be applied to learning a tool or mastering a skill. But only looking at tips and tricks and tool mastery in terms of the time saved leaves out the most important aspect! I argue that most often, even though mastery of a certain tool might not save you any time in the long run, there is still a huge benefit to it.\nThis benefit has to do with cognition, the way our brains work. As it stands, our working memory is tiny. I mean really, really tiny. The number 7 is often floated around as a ballpark for the number of chunks we can actively hold in memory to work with at the same time (“The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information. - PsycNET,” n.d.) and it seems to be largely correct. How then can we think more complex thoughts, you might ask? Surely even the sentence before this one had more than seven words, let alone individual characters! The trick lies in chunking and encoding information in such a way that multiple individual pieces of information are stored as just one chunk. When you read a word you already know, you don’t have to actively think about individual letters anymore, you can rely on your long term memory to store a reference to that word, or even the concept that the word entails. The more you know about something the more you can rely on that. This frees up your mind to think about other things or the bigger picture.\nTo come back to the tree-chopping-analogy:\n\nIf you practice chopping a tree such that you don’t have to think about individual motions anymore, and your axe is so sharp that you can cut down a tree in a single swing, then your mind will be free to think about the entire forest.\n\nAnd the same goes for learning your tools for data analysis as well. If you practice these skills and master theses tools, I guarantee that you are going to have ideas and insights you are only able to find because the details are muscle memory. So without further ado, here are my top recommendations for mastery:"

Since the keyboard is – and will be for the foreseeable future – the primary input method for interacting with a computer in a fast and efficient way, mastering your keyboard will go a long way. This will not only help you in writing code and talking to R more fluently, it will also help you bring your thoughts to the screen faster. Think about the possibilities of typing near the speed of thought! Here are two websites for deliberately practicing touch typing:\n\nhttps://www.keybr.com/\nhttps://monkeytype.com/\n\nI recommend to start with keybr to practice individual motions and combinations and move to monkeytype later when you want to work on real words.\n\n\nYour text editor and ide\nIn our case, this is of course RStudio, the IDE for R (Integrated Development Environment).\n\n\n\nYour operating system"

In the process we found that while there is a function in R for the standard deviation (sd), there is no such built-in function for the standard error of the mean. So we wrote our own tiny function called sem, which calculates just that. But if would be annoying if we had to put this function in every one of our analysis scripts!\nWrite a small package, which exports the sem function and publish it on GitHub. Make sure that you are able to install your very own package from there as well. As your exercise submission for this week, simply send me a link to your repository. Remember to ask questions in our discord server if you get stuck!\nBonus Tasks:\n\nWrite documentation for your sem function with roxygen and experience the joy of seeing your very own words on a help page.\nExtend your package with a custom ggplot theme function.\n\n\n\n\n\n“The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information. - PsycNET.” n.d.
